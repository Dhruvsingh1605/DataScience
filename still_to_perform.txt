‚ùå 1. Free-form consulting or open-ended advice
Example:

"What game should I invest in?"

"Tell me about trends in racing games."

"Why are JRPGs declining?"

üß† Why it fails:

No clear action/target/filters.

These are opinion-based or require multi-hop reasoning and/or temporal context.

Gemini will either hallucinate JSON or output irrelevant structure.

‚úÖ Fix: Route such queries to a consulting module (LLM-based answer generation or retrieval QA).

‚ùå 2. Predictive / Forecasting questions
Example:

"Will action games sell more next year?"

"Predict sales in 2026 for Nintendo games."

üß† Why it fails:

No "future" data in tabular dataset.

Requires time-series or ML forecasting model ‚Äî which JSON query structure cannot express.

‚úÖ Fix: Route to a forecasting engine (e.g., Prophet, LSTM, ARIMA, or sklearn pipeline).

‚ùå 3. Logical or comparative reasoning
Example:

"Are sports games more popular than racing games?"

"Which platform grew the most over the last decade?"

"Did Nintendo outperform Sony in the EU market?"

üß† Why it fails:

Needs comparison across filtered groups, multi-stage aggregation, or delta calculations.

Gemini may give you one valid filter/group_by, but not both sides of comparison.

‚úÖ Fix: Use a reasoning layer that computes multiple queries and compares them post hoc.

‚ùå 4. Ambiguous or underspecified questions
Example:

"Show me top games."

"Best-selling titles?"

"How is sales going?"

üß† Why it fails:

Lacks filters, timeframe, region ‚Äî the parser might default to global sales, all-time, no filter‚Ä¶ or guess incorrectly.

‚úÖ Fix: Add a query clarification layer or ask Gemini to request clarification if ambiguity is detected.

‚ùå 5. Non-column-based questions
Example:

"What does the 'Other_Sales' column mean?"

"Who created this dataset?"

"How many missing values are there?"

üß† Why it fails:

These are metadata, documentation, or data-quality questions ‚Äî not analytical queries.

‚úÖ Fix: Route to a data-docs assistant or schema documentation service.

‚ùå 6. Multistep / multi-action queries
Example:

"Show me the average global sales of action games, then compare it with strategy games."

"Give me top 5 genres in 2009 and their total sales."

üß† Why it fails:

One action per JSON output: can't express sequence or composition.

You‚Äôll get either action A or B ‚Äî not both.

‚úÖ Fix: Use a multi-query planner that chains or splits the input intelligently.

‚ùå 7. Queries involving external knowledge
Example:

"Did FIFA outsell Call of Duty in the World Cup year?"

"Was 2008 a recession year and did it affect game sales?"

üß† Why it fails:

These questions mix internal data with external world knowledge.

Your system has no access to real-world events or trends.

‚úÖ Fix: Integrate with a knowledge graph or external facts LLM.

‚úÖ Summary Table
Type	Supported?	Needs Extra Module
Simple analytical queries	‚úÖ	No
Grouped aggregations	‚úÖ	No
Forecasting	‚ùå	Time series model
Logical comparisons	‚ùå	Dual query & comparator
Free-form consulting	‚ùå	LLM QA / consulting agent
Metadata questions	‚ùå	Schema doc assistant
Ambiguous prompts	‚ùå	Clarifier or reask loop
Multi-step reasoning	‚ùå	Query planner
External knowledge queries	‚ùå	Web/knowledge augmentation

‚úÖ Your Next Step
Now that you know what the system can‚Äôt do, I suggest building a query router that:

Classifies query type (analytical, prediction, consulting, etc.).

Routes to the correct backend module.

Fallbacks gracefully when Gemini can‚Äôt parse the query.

Let me know if you want a lightweight classifier or OpenRouter + prompt router for this.







‚úÖ Sales Queries
"What are the total global sales of action games?"

"How many units did Nintendo sell in Europe in 2012?"

"What was the highest selling game in Japan in 2010?"

"Which publisher had the most sales in North America in 2011?"

"Give me global sales of sports games in 2008."

‚úÖ Ranking & Top-K
"Top 5 best-selling games globally in 2009?"

"Top 3 genres by sales in EU in 2014?"

"Which game sold the most in Japan?"

"Who are the top 10 publishers in 2015 by global sales?"

‚úÖ Filtering by Year/Genre/Platform/Region
"Sales of racing games on PS2 in 2007?"

"How did Xbox 360 perform in Europe in 2009?"

"What was the NA sales for shooter games released in 2011?"

‚úÖ Grouping + Aggregation
"Total sales per genre in 2013?"

"Which platform had the most games in 2012?"

"Compare average sales across all genres."

‚úÖ Counts and Frequencies
"How many games were released in 2005?"

"Number of games by Nintendo in 2010?"

"How many sports games were released on PS3?"

‚úÖ Max/Min Queries
"Which genre had the highest global sales in 2011?"

"Who was the top publisher in North America in 2014?"

"Which game ranked #1 globally in 2009?"

‚úÖ Platform Performance
"Best performing console in Japan overall?"

"Sales distribution for Xbox One vs PS4?"

"Which console dominated in EU in 2013?"

‚úÖ Yearly Trends
"What were the global sales every year?"

"Which year had the highest number of releases?"

"Compare global sales in 2008 vs 2009."

üß† Bonus: Example of Synonym Handling (already works)
These are interpreted correctly due to injected synonyms:

"Launch year of GTA V" ‚Üí Year

"Total worldwide sales of FIFA" ‚Üí Global_Sales

"Console with top performance in JP" ‚Üí Platform, region=JP_Sales

‚ùå WHAT IT CANNOT DO (yet, unless extended)
These are out of scope for current capabilities, unless you add prediction/forecasting modules:

"Will Action games sell more next year?" ‚Üí Needs time-series forecast

"Recommend a genre to publish in 2025?" ‚Üí Needs ML + reasoning

"Compare trends of shooter vs sports from 2000 to 2020" ‚Üí Needs line chart generator or NLP-to-plot module
